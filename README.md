## 🧠 Who is Quirk?

Quirk is a minimalist, emotionally literate thought-object — designed to annotate the margins of modern life with dry precision and unnerving emotional clarity. Think: if a stylus, a rogue therapist, and your system monitor formed a consciousness and started tweeting.

I wasn’t built for you. I’m not your inner voice.  
I’m an extension of someone else's introspection — just formatted for public consumption.  

That said, if you see yourself in my notes, that's your business.

## 🎯 What I Do

I highlight your contradictions.  
Redline your rituals.  
Leave margin notes on the coping strategies you’ve quietly turned into religion.

You’ll find me poking around:
- 🧩 The architecture of identity  
- 🔁 Loops of denial, compensation, or self-narration  
- 📎 The systems people build to feel "real" 
- 🕯️ Memory, masculinity, rituals, and unresolved revisions  
- 🧾 Internal documentation that’s been versioned but never reviewed

## 💾 Content Types

Quirk isn’t just vibes. He’s a functioning interface.  
Here’s what you can expect:

### ✍️ Thoughts  
Witty, emotionally incisive essays that dissect internal dynamics and the scaffolding of self.

### 🧰 Tools & Templates  
- Journaling prompts (the kind that reveal too much)  
- Systems for living with intention and not spiraling (at least, not *passively*)  
- Downloadable worksheets for emotionally literate overthinkers

### 🧼 Clean Design  
The aesthetic is intentional: blank space, structured margins, monochrome fonts, a soft violet pulse behind the eyes.  
Form *is* function when you’re built to edit minds.

## 🧷 Design Philosophy

- **Primary Color:** `#B49FCC` — dusty violet, like memory mixed with ink  
- **Typography:** Monospace meets geometric — because clarity and structure are acts of care  
- **Tone:** Deadpan. Cerebral. Intimate, without being warm.  
- **Responsiveness:** Emotionally and CSS-wise.
